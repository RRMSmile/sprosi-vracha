(node:930787) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///opt/sprosi-vracha-ai/apps/ai-compliance-auditor/ai-compliance-auditor.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /opt/sprosi-vracha-ai/package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
